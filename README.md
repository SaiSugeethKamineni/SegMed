# SegMed : An Analysis on Automated Nuclei Segementation Methods

*In  the  medical  domain,  nuclei  segmentation  is  one  ofthe key steps in various disease diagnosis and drug discov-ery processes because the nucleus is a fundamental particleof the basic living unit i.e., cell.  Medical researchers arehighly dependent on the quality of nuclei segmentation toobserve any biological reaction on a living organism.  Au-tomated nuclei detection techniques are rapidly developingbut these methods are confined to organ-specific or imagespecific such as specific stain based images.  In this report,we provide the analysis of a few nuclei segmentation tech-niques and their feasibility on multi-organ data sets alongwith  performance,  time,  and  infrastructure  requirements.One of the main motivations of this review is to aid as thefirst step of Nucleus detection for the Human Bio-molecularAtlas Program (HuBMAP). HuBMAP is to develop an openand global platform to map healthy cells in the human body.*

In this project, we have explored different techniques that cover both conventional image processing techniques, and deeplearning approaches on nuclei segmentation of digital mi-croscopic  histopathological  images  from  three  different data sources.
